# Code The Dream PreWork Assignment

Here is my submission for the CTD prework assigment. I chose to create a webpage using Spotify's API to display the top 5 albums and the top 5 playlists of the day.

### Features

I built this webpage using React.js and implemented a Spotify Client class in JavaScript where all my API calls are implemented and client credentials are handled.

### Functionality

This webpage fetches the top 5 albums and top 5 playlists of the day in their respective tabs. If the user clicks on the album card, they will be navigated to Spotify's webpage of the respective album or playlist. Similarly, if they click on a specific song, they will be navigated to Spotify's webpage displaying the song.

## How to run

### Live Webpage

The webpage will be hosted on this [link](https://ctd-prework-assignment.onrender.com/#){:target="\_blank"}. Simply open it in a new tab and see it in action.

### Locally

If the link above doesn't work for some reason, you can run the webpage locally by cloning this github repository, navigating into the client folder, and running

```
npm install
```

Once all packages are installed, run

```
npm run dev
```

The webpage should now be hosted locally and should run on your [localhost](http://localhost:5173/)
